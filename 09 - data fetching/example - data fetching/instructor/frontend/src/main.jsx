  /* We're basically just writing out the props that would otherwise be passed
     to Route components in the declarative syntax we're replacing for react-router.

     The idea here is, when we go to delegate data loading for a given route to
     the router, the data will come preloaded. Because doing that with vanilla React
     would mean relying on effects, rendering things twice, etc., we can't just call
     <Route /> components in the JSX because they'd be forced to get their external
     data last (useEffect <--> component lifecycle).

     Two birds, one stone here, but both these things are interdependent:
       - what if we made routing responsible for delivering data at a given route?
         (cleans up component scope -> now just receive data, render UI/JSX)
       - what if we made the external data immediately available to the component?
         (bypass the lifecycle constraints of component rendering -> external data)
